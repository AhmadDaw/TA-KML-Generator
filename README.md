# TA-KML-Generator
A desktop application to quikly generate Google Earth files in one click, build using Python, simplekml, Pandas, Numpy and Tkinter, the application can read the data from excel file or database and preprocess the data and output the data to a Google Earth (KML) file, the user can see the data represent on geographic areas.

To run the code follow the steps:

1. Create the virtual environment in Python. You can name it anything, here we'll use "myenv": 
`virtualenv myenv`

2. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`source myenv/bin/activate` 
- On Windows:
`myenv\Scripts\activate`

4. Your command prompt will now start with `(myenv)` indicating you are in the virtual environment.

5. To recreate the environment run: 
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

6. To deactivate the virtual environment, run:

- On Linux/Mac: 
`deactivate`
- On Windows: 
`deactivate.bat` 

Your command prompt will no longer have `(myenv)`
